## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum, a rotational inverted pendulum, was invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues. Often used to demonstrate nonlinear control laws, the inverted pendulum consists of a driving arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and the pendulum attached to that arm, which is free to rotate in the vertical plane. This project requires deriving a mathematical model of the Furuta Pendulum which can be inputted into MATLAB. A Coppliasim model of the Furuta Pendulum will then be linked to MATLAB in order to create the simulated pendulum.
