## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum, a rotational inverted pendulum, was invented in 1992 at Tokyo Institute of Technology by Katsuhisa Furuta and his colleagues. Often used to demonstrate nonlinear control laws, the inverted pendulum consists of a driving arm which rotates in the horizontal plane and the pendulum attached to that arm, which is free to rotate in the vertical plane. The objective of this project is to design and implement a state-feedback control system that will balance the pendulum in the upright, vertical position. This requires deriving a mathematical model of the Furuta Pendulum and a controller for the system which can be inputted into MATLAB. Coppliasim will then be used to create a simulated version of the system that can be linked back to MATLAB.
