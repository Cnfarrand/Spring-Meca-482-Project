## 1. Introduction
The Furuta Pendulum was invented by Katsuhisa Furuta in 1992 and has since been a widely used tool for teaching the principles of control systems design. The device consists of a motor, which is mounted to a base, that rotates about the vertical axis, and an arm which is free to rotate about the horizontal axis. The arm and motor are connected by a horizontal rod that protrudes from the motor. The goal of this project is to devise a system capable of maintaining the arm balanced upright by controlling the rotation of the motor about the vertical axis.
